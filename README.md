# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, New Zealand company number, Australian ACN/ABN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 35 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP, plus [Senzing JSON](https://www.senzing.com/docs/entity_specification/) entity records for entity resolution, [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech/) entities for OpenSanctions / OpenAleph investigative workflows, a [BigQuery property-graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/property-graphs) package queryable with GQL, [Google AML AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/schemas/aml-input-data-model) input tables, and [BODS RDF](https://vocab.openownership.org/pages/4_convertingdata.html) as TriG for linked-data and SPARQL workflows).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 83** — EITI State-Owned Enterprises Database as a new open data source

A new LEI-keyed source (`eiti_soe`) surfacing state-owned enterprises reported through the EITI, distinct from the existing `eiti` payments adapter. The SOE data carries no native LEI, so each SOE is resolved to an LEI at index-build time via GLEIF into a committed index; the BODS mapping emits a `stateBody` government plus a `controlByLegalFramework` relationship, which raises the existing `STATE_CONTROLLED` risk signal with no risk-engine or frontend changes. Category `cdd`; licence clean (used directly from EITI, not the CC-BY-NC OpenSanctions mirror). ([commit 7f54617](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck/commit/7f54617f469bb2eaae462db7339b9abf0c9f66d7))

**Previous: Phase 82** — BackgroundCheck: risk checks on the people connected to an entity

A third check mode alongside QuickCheck and FullCheck brings the **people** behind an entity — officers, directors and beneficial owners — to the fore, returning to the original plan's unbuilt "person lookups" phase. The connected-people list is extracted from the assembled BODS bundle itself (source-agnostic: Estonian beneficial owners surface exactly like UK officers), and each person can be screened on demand across every person-capable source (Companies House officers, OpenSanctions, EveryPolitician, Wikidata, OpenAleph) via `GET /person-check`. Evidence discipline throughout: screening is name-based, so risk signals derive only from **strong matches** (name similarity ≥ 0.88 with a compatible birth year), every signal carries its match evidence, failed sources render as "not screened", and a clean screen is never presented as proof of absence. Identifier-backed enrichment goes deeper: Companies House officer ids unlock a person's appointments across companies, EveryPolitician records open into dated positions-held timelines (Poliloom-maintained, keyed to Wikidata Q-IDs), and Wikidata person searches now filter to actual humans. Person reports are first-class artefacts — shareable via `?person=` URLs, downloadable as BODS person subgraphs, exposed to agents through the `opencheck_person_check` MCP tool, and reachable from a new homepage person-name search tab. (PR #69)

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The BOVS icons and country-flag SVGs are committed under `frontend/public/`, so the dev server needs no extra build step.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle; the RDF export additionally stamps each statement with its source's canonical licence URI (`bods:license`), so the licensing information is machine-readable and travels with the data itself.

The frontend renders ownership graphs with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (MIT). It re-uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens (CC BY 4.0) and the BOVS entity/person icons and country-flag SVGs from Open Ownership's [visualisation library](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) (Apache 2.0) — both © Open Ownership. The committed assets live under `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/`, a directory name retained from their original source.

## Roadmap

- **Live opentender.eu integration** — the adapter is wired but `live_available=False` for now.
- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
