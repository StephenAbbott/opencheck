# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, New Zealand company number, Australian ACN/ABN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 35 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP, plus [Senzing JSON](https://www.senzing.com/docs/entity_specification/) entity records for entity resolution, [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech/) entities for OpenSanctions / OpenAleph investigative workflows, a [BigQuery property-graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/property-graphs) package queryable with GQL, [Google AML AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/schemas/aml-input-data-model) input tables, and [BODS RDF](https://vocab.openownership.org/pages/4_convertingdata.html) as TriG for linked-data and SPARQL workflows).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 89** — privacy-respecting analytics: GoatCounter, wired so subjects can never leak

Cookie-less GoatCounter now counts visits on both surfaces — the SPA and the server-rendered entity/browse pages — with the ticket's privacy constraint enforced at a single choke-point: recorded paths are rolled up to fixed buckets (`?lei=` lookups become `/lookup`, entity pages become `/entity`), so no Legal Entity Identifier, person name or query string ever reaches analytics, and feature usage is counted as anonymous events (`lookup_run`, `pdf_export`, `share_link`, …) rather than subjects. Per-entity search interest comes from Google Search Console instead. Privacy notes ship in the entity-page footer and a new "Privacy & analytics" card on the About page; setting `OPENCHECK_GOATCOUNTER_ENDPOINT` to empty removes every trace. Commit `42d8c0f`.

**Previous: Phase 88** — SEO entity pages: a crawlable URL for every LEI, from GLEIF bulk data alone

Every entity with a Legal Entity Identifier now has a stable, server-rendered page at `/entity/{LEI}-{name-slug}` — ~3.4M of them — built from the GLEIF Golden Copy files by a streaming SQLite builder (full rebuild or GLEIF's 31-day delta for the monthly refresh). Pages carry the SEO ticket's exact furniture (title `NAME - OpenCheck`, fixed meta description, canonical, Open Graph, JSON-LD `Organization` with `leiCode`) plus GLEIF reference data: status badge, registered address, ELF legal form, direct/ultimate parents and consolidated children from the relationship file, successor links for merged entities. Sitemap index + 50k-URL shards and `/browse/{country}` hub pages handle discovery; a backend `robots.txt` keeps crawlers off the live-lookup API. The design rule throughout: **GLEIF-local only** — crawling all 3.4M pages costs zero third-party API calls, and live checks fire only from the page's CTA into the app's `?lei=` flow. Because Render static rewrites can't proxy cross-service, the deploy gains an inert single-service mode (`OPENCHECK_FRONTEND_DIST`) that serves the built SPA from the API process for the cutover. Commit `d7efd38`.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The BOVS icons and country-flag SVGs are committed under `frontend/public/`, so the dev server needs no extra build step.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle; the RDF export additionally stamps each statement with its source's canonical licence URI (`bods:license`), so the licensing information is machine-readable and travels with the data itself.

The frontend renders ownership graphs with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (MIT). It re-uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens (CC BY 4.0) and the BOVS entity/person icons and country-flag SVGs from Open Ownership's [visualisation library](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) (Apache 2.0) — both © Open Ownership. The committed assets live under `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/`, a directory name retained from their original source.

## Roadmap

- **Live opentender.eu integration** — the adapter is wired but `live_available=False` for now.
- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
