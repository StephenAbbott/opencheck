# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, New Zealand company number, Australian ACN/ABN, Indian CIN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 38 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP, plus [Senzing JSON](https://www.senzing.com/docs/entity_specification/) entity records for entity resolution, [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech/) entities for OpenSanctions / OpenAleph investigative workflows, a [BigQuery property-graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/property-graphs) package queryable with GQL, [Google AML AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/schemas/aml-input-data-model) input tables, and [BODS RDF](https://vocab.openownership.org/pages/4_convertingdata.html) as TriG for linked-data and SPARQL workflows).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 108** — the register's own words, finally visible

Phase 103 began emitting BODS annotations — the Companies House nature-of-control code behind a rendered interest type, a note that a birth date was published month-and-year-only rather than truncated by OpenCheck — and Phase 107 carried them into RDF. Neither put them in front of a user: nothing in the frontend read them, so the register's words arrived in the browser on every lookup and were discarded at the last step. The results page now marks any transformed value with a dotted underline and offers a persistent "as filed" toggle — on, the register's words lead and OpenCheck's reading follows in muted text, that order deliberately, since the point is showing whose vocabulary you are reading. The setting is shared across every source card rather than held per card, defaults to OpenCheck's reading, and only appears where a bundle actually carries annotations. Pointer matching is exact rather than prefix, so an annotation about one interest can never be attributed to its sibling. Commit `ed448cf`.

**Previous: Phase 107** — RDF had the annotation vocabulary all along and never used it

Phase 103 began emitting BODS `annotations` — the register's own nature-of-control code, a note that a birth date was published imprecise rather than truncated — and the RDF export dropped every one. Not for want of vocabulary: `rdf.py` already emitted the full `Annotation` term set, built in Phase 81 and wired only to OpenCheck's own risk signals. The two kinds now share an emitter and are separated by graph rather than predicate: statement annotations in the statement's graph, analysis annotations in the analysis graph, so a consumer can ask for either. Pointers travel verbatim rather than being re-derived. Also corrects a namespace wrong since Phase 81 — codelist terms pointed at `standard.openownership.org/codelists#`, taken from the published Turtle's prefix line, which Open Ownership confirm is an error in that file; the correct base is `vocab.openownership.org/codelists#`, and the published Estonia corpus needs regenerating as a result. Senzing and FtM still drop annotations, which is correct. Commit `6396079`.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The BOVS icons and country-flag SVGs are committed under `frontend/public/`, so the dev server needs no extra build step.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle; the RDF export additionally stamps each statement with its source's canonical licence URI (`bods:license`), so the licensing information is machine-readable and travels with the data itself.

The frontend renders ownership graphs with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (MIT). It re-uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens (CC BY 4.0) and the BOVS entity/person icons and country-flag SVGs from Open Ownership's [visualisation library](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) (Apache 2.0) — both © Open Ownership. The committed assets live under `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/`, a directory name retained from their original source.

## Roadmap

- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
