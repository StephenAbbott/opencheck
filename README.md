# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, New Zealand company number, Australian ACN/ABN, Indian CIN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 38 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP, plus [Senzing JSON](https://www.senzing.com/docs/entity_specification/) entity records for entity resolution, [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech/) entities for OpenSanctions / OpenAleph investigative workflows, a [BigQuery property-graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/property-graphs) package queryable with GQL, [Google AML AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/schemas/aml-input-data-model) input tables, and [BODS RDF](https://vocab.openownership.org/pages/4_convertingdata.html) as TriG for linked-data and SPARQL workflows).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 107** — RDF had the annotation vocabulary all along and never used it

Phase 103 began emitting BODS `annotations` — the register's own nature-of-control code, a note that a birth date was published imprecise rather than truncated — and the RDF export dropped every one. Not for want of vocabulary: `rdf.py` already emitted the full `Annotation` term set, built in Phase 81 and wired only to OpenCheck's own risk signals. The two kinds now share an emitter and are separated by graph rather than predicate: statement annotations in the statement's graph, analysis annotations in the analysis graph, so a consumer can ask for either. Pointers travel verbatim rather than being re-derived. Also corrects a namespace wrong since Phase 81 — codelist terms pointed at `standard.openownership.org/codelists#`, taken from the published Turtle's prefix line, which Open Ownership confirm is an error in that file; the correct base is `vocab.openownership.org/codelists#`, and the published Estonia corpus needs regenerating as a result. Senzing and FtM still drop annotations, which is correct. Commit `6396079`.

**Previous: Phase 106** — a name is not an identification

Phase 105 fixed how the Liverpool FC hit was described; this fixes whether it should have attached to that person at all. Measuring the match gate rather than tuning it produced the governing fact: `Michael R. Gordon` and `Michael E. Gordon` — definitively different people — score 0.9375, *above* the 0.9333 of the genuine abbreviation pair. A middle initial is two characters, so no threshold separates them and raising the gate drops true positives first. Discrimination now comes from a second attribute: birth year or nationality, requiring both sides to supply it. That asymmetry was the bug — the Russian MFA record publishes no birth date, and knowing our own side's date was being read as agreement. Person signals are capped when nothing but the name agrees, and every such match now opens "Possible name match only" rather than asserting identity. Entities keep the score-only ladder; an organisation name is distinctive in a way a personal name is not. Commit `57adc39`.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The BOVS icons and country-flag SVGs are committed under `frontend/public/`, so the dev server needs no extra build step.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle; the RDF export additionally stamps each statement with its source's canonical licence URI (`bods:license`), so the licensing information is machine-readable and travels with the data itself.

The frontend renders ownership graphs with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (MIT). It re-uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens (CC BY 4.0) and the BOVS entity/person icons and country-flag SVGs from Open Ownership's [visualisation library](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) (Apache 2.0) — both © Open Ownership. The committed assets live under `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/`, a directory name retained from their original source.

## Roadmap

- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
