# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, New Zealand company number, Australian ACN/ABN, Indian CIN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 38 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP, plus [Senzing JSON](https://www.senzing.com/docs/entity_specification/) entity records for entity resolution, [FollowTheMoney](https://followthemoney.tech/) entities for OpenSanctions / OpenAleph investigative workflows, a [BigQuery property-graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/property-graphs) package queryable with GQL, [Google AML AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/schemas/aml-input-data-model) input tables, and [BODS RDF](https://vocab.openownership.org/pages/4_convertingdata.html) as TriG for linked-data and SPARQL workflows).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 103** — provenance annotations: what the register said, not just what OpenCheck read

The mapper transformed a great deal and recorded none of it. Two findings inverted the planned scope. BODS already models date imprecision exactly where it occurs — `birthDate` legally accepts `YYYY-MM` *because* registers like Companies House publish month and year only, deliberately, for privacy, so rounding it would fabricate a day the register withheld on purpose. And the real loss was vocabulary, not dates: Companies House nature-of-control codes are deliberately not modelled as BODS interest types, so the code identity survived only inside an English prose descriptor — which is exactly why the `NOMINEE` risk signal depends on the word "nominee" appearing in a sentence. Interests now carry a `transformation` annotation naming the register's own code, and imprecise birth dates a `commenting` one stating the source never disclosed the rest. The rule throughout: the statement carries the usable value, the annotation carries the register's words. Also ships `docs/dates.md`, owed since Phase 99. Commit `e67ae55`.

**Previous: Phase 102** — beneficial ownership is asserted, never inferred

BODS distinguishes `true`, `false` and **absent** ("not stated") for `beneficialOwnershipOrControl`, and OpenCheck was collapsing the third into the first in five places — inferring beneficial ownership from the *shape* of the interest rather than from anything a source had said. A shareholding is a legal holding; whether it is also a beneficial one is a separate fact only a register or a BO declaration regime can supply. The reasoning was already written down for the FollowTheMoney path and had simply never been applied to the commercial-register mappers; it now lives once, with an explicit source classification. SEC EDGAR gets the sharpest fix: a 13D/13G "beneficial owner" is an SEC-rules term meaning voting or dispositive power, so an investment adviser voting client shares qualifies without any economic interest — the `typeOfReportingPerson` code that distinguishes them was parsed all along and never read. Over-claiming here is the wrong direction of error for a transparency tool: it is a reputational assertion about a named person, and it travels into every export well beyond any caveat the interface can attach. Commit `f5333e1`.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The BOVS icons and country-flag SVGs are committed under `frontend/public/`, so the dev server needs no extra build step.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle; the RDF export additionally stamps each statement with its source's canonical licence URI (`bods:license`), so the licensing information is machine-readable and travels with the data itself.

The frontend renders ownership graphs with [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (MIT). It re-uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens (CC BY 4.0) and the BOVS entity/person icons and country-flag SVGs from Open Ownership's [visualisation library](https://github.com/openownership/visualisation-tool) (Apache 2.0) — both © Open Ownership. The committed assets live under `frontend/public/bods-dagre-images/`, a directory name retained from their original source.

## Roadmap

- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
