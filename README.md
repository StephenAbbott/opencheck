# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Australian ACN/ABN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 30 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 55** — Malta Business Registry adapter: OpenCheck's 30th source

A live, key-less national-register adapter over the Malta Business Registry Open Data API — the first source found by systematically sweeping the EU's High-Value Datasets on [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu/).

1. **GLEIF-bridged, no key.** `mt_crn` (e.g. `C 113927`) is derived from GLEIF RA code `RA000443` and handed straight to `GET /api/v1/companies/{registration_number}`. The MBR API is an EU Open Data Directive High-Value Dataset — no auth, no API key, CC BY 4.0.
2. **One entity record → one BODS statement.** Name, legal form, status, registered office and registration date map to a single `entityStatement` (`MT-MBR` scheme, MT jurisdiction). The API exposes entity data only — no officers or beneficial owners — and has no name search, so the source is entered via the LEI flow.
3. **Searchable by registration number.** Malta is wired into the National ID search panel (`C 113927`), so you can look a company up directly, not only via its LEI.
4. **Verified live.** 18 unit tests plus an opt-in live smoke test that fetches a real MBR record and asserts valid BODS (also a production access check); live-verified against Blue Lagoon Holding Limited.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first frontend build copies bundled images for `@openownership/bods-dagre` into `public/bods-dagre-images/`. If they're missing, run `npm run build` once.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle.

The frontend also uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens and `@openownership/bods-dagre`, both © Open Ownership and re-used under CC BY 4.0 / Apache 2.0 respectively.

## Roadmap

- **Live opentender.eu integration** — the adapter is wired but `live_available=False` for now.
- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
