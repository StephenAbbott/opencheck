# OpenCheck

Customer due diligence risk checks powered by the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), open data and open standards - including the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (BODS). 

Try the demo at **https://opencheck.world/**

## What is OpenCheck?

You paste in a [Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei). OpenCheck queries [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) first, derives every cross-source identifier it can (UK Companies House number, Norwegian organisation number, Irish company registration number, Finnish Y-tunnus, Latvian registration number, Lithuanian entity code, Estonian registry code, Czech IČO, Polish KRS number, Austrian Firmenbuchnummer, Slovak IČO, French SIREN, Dutch KvK number, Swedish organisation number, Swiss UID, Canadian corporation number, Belgian enterprise number, Danish CVR number, Croatian MBS, Maltese registration number, Brazilian CNPJ, Australian ACN/ABN, OpenCorporates ID, Wikidata Q-ID, and more), and uses those bridges to fan out across 31 national and international corporate data sources.

Everything maps into [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/). Cross-source links and risk signals are computed deterministically, and the whole bundle is one click away from a downloadable export (JSON / JSONL / XML / ZIP).

The risk-signal layer mirrors the [EU AMLA draft customer due diligence regulatory technical standards](https://www.amla.europa.eu/policy/public-consultations/consultation-draft-rts-customer-due-diligence_en) conditions for "complex corporate structures" — trust/arrangement, non-EU jurisdiction, nominee, ≥3 ownership layers, plus the composite threshold rule and an advisory mirror of the subjective obfuscation condition.

## Status

**Latest: Phase 58** — Time Machine: change-over-time timelines (GLEIF + Companies House)

A new **Time Machine** that reconstructs an entity's notable ownership and identity changes over time and renders them as a timeline — the temporal half of [BODS v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) (`statementDate`, the `recordId` + `recordStatus` new/updated/closed lifecycle, interest `startDate`/`endDate`) that almost no demo surfaces, shown across **two sources on one axis**.

1. **Two live change streams, one model.** Both GLEIF (its per-LEI field-level modification log) and Companies House (typed filing history) expose a live, per-entity change stream — so detection is just a per-source allowlist into one shared, raw-first `ChangeEvent` codelist, with no snapshot-diffing or data hoarding.
2. **The noise is the product.** An allowlist suppresses administrative churn (a GLEIF `NextRenewalDate` renewal is the twin of a Companies House CS01 "confirmed, no change"), surfacing only material moves — owners added/removed, name / legal-form / status changes, new parents — with a toggle to reveal the rest.
3. **Multi-source, reconciled, honest.** Cross-source identity changes are de-duplicated and corroborated (a PLC→Limited rename shows both sources, the Companies House *effective* date beating GLEIF's *recorded* date); ownership interest dates come from the relationship period, not the publish date; every event labels whether its date is *as filed* or *as recorded*.
4. **Lazy `GET /history` + a vertical timeline rail.** A "See timeline" button on the GLEIF and Companies House source cards opens a rail below them — tier-coloured events, source chips linking back to GLEIF / Companies House, parent + interest dates for ownership changes. GLEIF is key-free; Companies House uses a dedicated `COMPANIES_HOUSE_HISTORY_API_KEY` and degrades gracefully when it's absent.

## Quick start

The backend ships with cache-first dispatch: in stub mode (no API keys, no `OPENCHECK_ALLOW_LIVE`) every adapter returns deterministic placeholder data. Live mode is opt-in per source via env vars.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000> (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`)

### Local (without Docker)

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn opencheck.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first frontend build copies bundled images for `@openownership/bods-dagre` into `public/bods-dagre-images/`. If they're missing, run `npm run build` once.

## Licensing

OpenCheck's own code is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE). Data retrieved from third-party sources is licensed under each source's own terms — see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Downloaded exports include a `LICENSES.md` listing every source that contributed data, with re-use guidance for the most-restrictive licence in the bundle.

The frontend also uses the [Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-visualisation-system/) design tokens and `@openownership/bods-dagre`, both © Open Ownership and re-used under CC BY 4.0 / Apache 2.0 respectively.

## Roadmap

- **Live opentender.eu integration** — the adapter is wired but `live_available=False` for now.
- **A "complex offshore" demo subject** that fires every AMLA chip simultaneously.
- **BODS RDF / SPARQL backbone** via Oxigraph — load the assembled BODS bundle into a triple store, expose `/sparql` for the published Open Ownership red-flag queries.

Open issues and discussion live in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/opencheck).
